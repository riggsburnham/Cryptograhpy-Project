Description:
Implemented the blowfish algorithm for my term project for cryptography. The program will take in a key of any size, pad the key and then will
generate the necessary sub key in order to encrypt some text. The program then will take in text of any size and encrypt the information
using the subkeys. Once encrypted the program will output the encrypted text in hex. You can then feed that encrypted text back to get the 
original text.
